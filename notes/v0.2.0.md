This is the first reproducible release of Bass.

Try downloading one of the attached `.json` files and running the following:

```sh
cat bass.linux-amd64.json | bass --export | tar -xf -
sha256sum bass.linux-amd64.tgz
```

Compare the output to the attached `sha256sums.txt` - it should match!

This feat is accomplished through two changes:

1. Thunk outputs now have their atime/mtime set to October 26, 1985.
   * Ever-shifting timestamps are the bane of reproducible builds. Clobbering
     them with an arbitrary value is an opinionated stance, but for a noble
     cause.
1. The images used for building Bass is now built with Nix, leveraging newly
   added support for using OCI image archives for thunks.
   * Don't worry, you'll never have to learn Nix to learn Bass - but using it
     for image builds seems like a great fit, so I decided to learn it!
