This release marks a major milestone: :tada: Bass now runs its own CI! The
GitHub Actions stack has been replaced with Bass Loop ([www][Bass Loop www],
[repo][Bass Loop repo]). See the [Bass Loop announcement] for more details.

There are a few breaking changes to Bass itself, most of them a long time
coming. This effort forced the issue on a lot of tentative decisions made in
Bass's past, bringing it that much closer to stability. Be sure to check [#186]
for extended notes.
