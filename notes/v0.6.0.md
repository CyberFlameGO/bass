This release marks a major milestone: Bass now runs its own CI. The GitHub
Actions stack has been replaced with [Bass Loop], running at
[loop.bass-lang.org](https://loop.bass-lang.org). See the the [announcement]
for more details.

There are quite a few breaking changes, most of them a long time coming. Be
sure to check [#186] for extended notes.
