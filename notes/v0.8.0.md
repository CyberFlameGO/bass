This release makes it easier to get started with Bass.

You don't need to set up Buildkit anymore. Bass will start its own Buildkit in
Docker instead, a technique yoinked from [Dagger]. If you already have Buildkit
set up you can keep using it. This change just lowers the barrier to entry.

Also: `bass --runner` (used for [Bass Loop]) will now display the remote host
key and prompt whether to save it instead of erroring out. Huzzah!
