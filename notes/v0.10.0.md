This is a big release that overhauls the networking stack and adds a new kind
of value: a *thunk addr*.

Thunks can now provide ports:

```clojure
(-> ($ python -m http.server 80)
    (with-image (linux/python))
    (with-port :http 80))
```

Ports can be referenced using a [thunk addr]. A thunk addr is a lot like a
[thunk path] except it represents to a TCP address instead of a filesystem
path.


```clojure
(def srv
  (-> ($ python -m http.server 80)
      (with-image (linux/python))
      (with-port :http 80)))

(-> ($ wget (addr srv :http "http://$host:$port"))
    (with-image (linux/ubuntu))
    run)
```

The server thunk runs lazily. The client thunk doesn't run until the server's
ports are listening.

Thunks no longer run in the host network. Instead they run in a [bridge
network] to prevent port collisions.

Thunks use DNS to address each other in order to maximize caching. (Using IPs
would introduce a source of randomness!)
