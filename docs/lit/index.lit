Bass is a scripting language for running commands and caching the shit out of
them.

Bass's goal is to make shipping software predictable, repeatable, and fun. The
plan is to support sophisticated CI/CD flows while sticking to familiar ideas.
CI/CD boils down to running commands. Bass leverages that instead of trying to
replace it.

If you'd like to try it out, grab the \link{latest
release}{https://github.com/vito/bass/releases/latest} and skim the
\reference{getting-started}{guide}!

\demo-literate{running commands}{
  Commands are represented as a data type called a \t{thunk}. Thunks are
  rendered as space invaders.
}{{{
  (from (linux/alpine)
    ($ echo "Hello, world!"))
}}}{
  You can \b{run} a thunk, \b{read} its output, or check if it \b{succeeds?}.
}{{{
  (def thunk
    (from (linux/alpine)
      ($ echo "Hello, world!")))

  [(run thunk) (next (read thunk :raw)) (succeeds? thunk)]
}}}{
  Files created by a thunk can be accessed using \t{thunk paths}.
}{{{
  (def create-file
    (from (linux/alpine)
      ($ sh -c "echo hello >> file")))

  (-> (from (linux/alpine)
        ($ cat create-file/file))
      (read :raw)
      next)
}}}

\demo-literate{fetching code}{
  Bass just runs commands, so you \italic{could} just run \code{git clone} to fetch 
  Bass fetches code by running commands. So to fetch a
  \link{Git}{https://git-scm.com} repo you could just run \code{git clone}.
}{{{
  (from (linux/alpine/git)
    ($ git clone "https://github.com/vito/bass" ./))
}}}{
  The approach above is pretty flawed; it doesn't say what commit to fetch, so
  it'll just fetch whatever's at \code{HEAD} and cache it. In other words this
  thunk is not \t{hermetic}.

  Bass comes with a \reference{git-module} that you should probably use
  instead. Under the hood it just runs commands like above. You just have to
  tell it what image to use for the \code{git} command.
}{{{
  (use (.git (linux/alpine/git)))

  (let [url "https://github.com/vito/bass"
        ref "main"]
    (git:checkout url (git:ls-remote url ref)))
}}}{
  A shorter way of referencing a repository as a pinnable dependency is to use
  the \b{git.github} path root:
}{{{
  git:github/vito/bass/ref/main/
}}}{
  The return value is a \t{thunk path}. It can be passed to other \t{thunks}:
}{{{
  (-> (from (linux/alpine)
        ($ ls -al git:github/vito/bass/ref/main/))
      (read :unix-table)
      next)
}}}

\demo-literate{running tests}{
  To run tests, just run whatever command you would usually use to run tests.
}{{{
  (use (.git (linux/alpine/git)))

  (defn go-test [src & args]
    (from (linux/golang)
      (cd src
        ($ go test & $args))))

  (let [src git:github/vito/booklit/ref/master/]
    (succeeds? (go-test src ./tests/)))
}}}{
  Don't use Go? Just use a different image and run a different command:
}{{{
  (defn cargo-test [src & args]
    (from (linux/rust)
      (cd src
        ($ cargo test & $args))))

  (let [src git:github/alacritty/alacritty/ref/master/]
    (succeeds? (cargo-test src ./alacritty_terminal/)))
}}}

\demo-literate{compiling code}{
  Predictably, to compile code just run whatever compilation command you
  already use.

  In this example we use \b{->} to avoid deeply nested function calls and
  \b{with-env} to set \code{CGO_ENABLED=0} so that we get a static binary.
}{{{
  (use (.git (linux/alpine/git)))

  (defn go-build [src & args]
    (from (linux/golang)
      (cd src
        (-> ($ go build & $args)
            (with-env {:CGO_ENABLED "0"})))))

  (let [src git:github/vito/booklit/ref/master/
        built (go-build src "./cmd/booklit")]
    (-> (from (linux/alpine)
          ($ built/booklit --version))
        (read :raw)
        next))
}}}

\demo-literate{using dependencies}{
  Guess how you load external \code{.bass} modules? Yep. You \b{use} a command.
}{{{
  (use (.git (linux/alpine/git)))

  (let [src git:github/vito/booklit/ref/master/]
    (use (src/bass/booklit.bass))
    (when (succeeds? (booklit:tests src))
      (booklit:build src "dev" "linux" "amd64")))
}}}{
  Bass doesn't have a package system, but it does support pinning dependencies
  by way of \b{memo}. I figure that's enough.

  The \b{git.github} and \b{linux} path roots memoize their result into the path
  defined in \bass{*memos*} (if present).
}{{{
  (def *memos* *dir*/bass.lock)

  (use (.git (linux/alpine/git))
       (git:github/vito/tabs/ref/main/wget.bass))

  (wget:wget "https://google.com" ./index.html)

  (run (from (linux/alpine)  ; caches into *memos*
          ($ cat $*memos*))) ; shows cached linux/alpine
}}}{
  To bump your dependencies, run \code{bass --bump}:

  \commands{{
  bass --bump bass.lock
  }}

  This command loads each module and re-evalutes the function call, updating
  the result in-place.

  There may come a day when selective bumping is needed. We'll cross that
  bridge if/when we get to it.
}

\demo-literate{webhook-driven CI/CD}{
  \link{Bass Loop}{https://loop.bass-lang.org} is a public service for calling
  Bass code in response to webhooks.

  First, install the \link{GitHub app}{https://github.com/apps/bass-ci} and put
  a script like this in your repo at \code{bass/github-hook}:
}{{{
  ; file for memoized dependency resolution
  (def *memos* *dir*/bass.lock)

  ; load dependencies
  (use (.git (linux/alpine/git))
       (git:github/vito/bass-loop/ref/main/bass/github.bass))

  ; run Go tests
  (defn go-test [src & args]
    (from (linux/golang)
      (cd src
        ($ go test & $args))))

  ; standard suite of validations for the repo
  (defn checks [src]
    {:test (go-test src "./...")})

  ; called by bass-loop
  (defn main []
    (for [event *stdin*]
      (github:check-hook event git:checkout checks)))
}}}{
  Next start a Bass runner to let Bass Loop use your local runtimes:

  \commands{{
  bass --runner myuser@github.bass-lang.org
  }}

  From here on any activity \code{myuser} does to the repo at GitHub.com will
  send an event \code{bass/github-hook} script with \code{myuser}'s runners
  available for running thunks.

  The \bass{github:check-hook} helper handles events for running checks. Each
  check configured in \bass{checks} will show up as a status check on the
  commit or PR.
}

\demo-literate{building images}{
  Bass eliminates the need for one-off \code{Dockerfiles} that are built and
  pushed to a registry to pulled into CI.

  You just write thunks instead!
}{{{
  (def deps
    (from (linux/alpine)
      ($ apk add wget)))

  (-> (from deps
        ($ wget --version))
      (read :unix-table)
      next)
}}}{
  The \link{Nix}{https://nixos.org} purists are probably seething right now.
  This isn't \t{hermetic} at all! The version of \code{wget} is a total
  wildcard! What if it changes? The house of cards could come crumbling down!

  Worry not: you can use any command you want to build images, so just use
  \code{nix build}. Just create an \link{OCI image
  tarball}{https://github.com/opencontainers/image-spec/blob/main/image-layout.md}
  and then use that image to run other thunks.
}{{{
  (use (.git (linux/alpine/git)))

  (let [tabs git:github/vito/tabs/ref/main/]
    (use (tabs/nix.bass))

    (def image
      {:file (nix:result
               (cd tabs/
                 ($ nix build ".#wget"))
               ./image.tar)
       :platform {:os "linux"}
       :tag "latest"})

    (-> (from image
          ($ wget --version))
        (read :unix-table)
        next))
}}}{
  Bass does everything it can to support and leverage \t{hermetic} properties
  of thunks, but it stops short of enforcing it.

  If Nix isn't worth the investment yet, YOLO and \code{apt-get} the night
  away. If you want to change that later, just change your image definition.
