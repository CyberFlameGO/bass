# CNI testing

This is a testing ground for making sure I've got the CNI incantations right.
I'm a noob at networking and the docs are a little over my head. When this
stuff fails (e.g. containers can't reach each other or the host) it's really
hard to understand, and sometimes it's fixed by a reboot, having a quick
sanity-check helps.
